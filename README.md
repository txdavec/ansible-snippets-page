# ansible-snippets-page

This project will create a web page of snippets for commonly used ansible modules.
I use different text editors so having the snippets in a web page instead of trying to sync them up in every editor helps.

Snippet content is generated via the `ansible-doc` command.

## Usage
```
./build.sh > index.html
```
